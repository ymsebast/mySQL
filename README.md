# MySQL Amazon 
 Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

## NPM Installs
Save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your json file.

## Customer View 
The app prompts the customer with two messages:

* The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
* The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, app checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If it does, show user total price of their order and confirm order.
After confirmation, SQL database is updated.
